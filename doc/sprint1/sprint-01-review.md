## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

- When: 2023 June 16
- Where: Online (Discord)

## Process - Reflection

We finished most of the planned tasks in the sprint for implementing users and events, but didn’t get to every aspect of them.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- Assignment of tasks was done well — everyone completed their tasks on time and features were developed beyond the bare minimum requirements.
- Auth features were successful because they worked in postman and in frontend. Encrypted for safety as well.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- Not everyone had major work to talk about in every standup so not all have a full five member contribution
- Not enough work to divide among everyone equally

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Distribute user stories more evenly because we did not do that in sprint1 which led to work being divided unevenly.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- From most to least important.
- Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
- If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

- Added login/logout/registration forms — [Log In Story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-3?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiODA3ZDczMjVlZTc1NDZjYWE0ODhkZGU1NTQzNWIwZjUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), [Log Out Story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-4?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNGQ1ZDFiNjgyNmQ2NDNiMDk4NzMzYzNhNGVhMGQ0MWMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), [Basic Sign Up Story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-2?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiOTI3Zjg3YzRlZDRlNDc3YTg3NTJiZTgxZWQ4MmM5MzEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), [Premium Sign Up Story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-1?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2RkMTJlZGI1OTVmNDI3NGJkMWNhYjk3NTQ0MDg4N2QiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)
- Added event board — [Event Board Story](https://limeade.atlassian.net/browse/LIM-9?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWQ2NmFhOTQ2MjdhNGZiM2I0OWJmMzNhMmVjMjk1NDMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- From most to least important.
- For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.  
  e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

- Event details pages — Realized that the creation of events may require more thinking and discussion on what we wanted to be there and how that would be represented.
- User profiles page — an additional story that we considered but did not complete, honestly it was optional.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- 2 - 4 items
- Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
- High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
- These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
- Can be related to product and/or process.

- Everyone should have some major work, either at least one feature per person or one to multiple documents to write depending on content required to be written.
- We will determine enough work to divide evenly, though the team may have to take on more features than is required per sprint so that it is fair for each member of the team.
