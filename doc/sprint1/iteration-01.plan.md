# GoGo / Limeade planning meeting

## Product

- Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

---

- Implement users and register/sign in/sign out actions

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

- Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
- Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
- Be concise, yet precise.  
  For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

- Building an interactive website demo that can be built and run as a demo
